   # Saving Bachata Exchange

The following was a personal project I created using my skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to help a campaign aimed at saving one of my favorite local dance events called Bachata Exchange in London. My contribution involved using NLP methods to collate and express the positive value of the event, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly positive reviews from its patrons.

The first step of the project was to scrape the data from tripadvisor. To do this I used a service called [scrapeHero CLoud](https://cloud.scrapehero.com/crawlers) to scrape the reviews from Bachata exchanges associated tripadvisor page [see](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186338-d26663269-Reviews-Bachata_Exchange-London_England.html).


### Success
Overall the efforts invested by the various indivdauls to save Bachata Exchagne were succesful with its return to London dance scene confirmed.
