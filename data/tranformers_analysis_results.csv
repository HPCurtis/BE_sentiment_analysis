What. An. Event. After moving to London full time, I started teaching at BE around once a month. Seeing how much joy people experienced from an amazing combination of a beautiful venue, a giving community, total acceptance of skill/level from others and connecting with new people creates such an ease drive for us as teachers (and as social dancers!) at BE. The venue is unparalleled in London. We don’t get much sun here in the UK, so an open spot that gives us all the light we can get, is breathable, spacious and beautiful is clearly one of the reasons people travel from (literally) other cities every week to make it to BE. The community is amazing, people feel safe and respected. The music is 👌. The location is glorious. It’s a staple for people’s social, mental and physical well-being.

The teachers explained everything so thoroughly.

I explained I was a beginner and it was my first class but he didn’t mind and encouraged me. (Shout out to Mark who I’m still friends with & still dance bachata with!).Because of that I ended up staying and dancing for hours & started dancing bachata a few times a week.But I always return to bachata exchange as it’s such a relaxed and fun environment and an unrivalled community.

956325033,Kyra,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/KyraC40,Access for all,I value BE a lot. It is so important to have an event/venue that is suitable for all types of people. I have danced for some time and when I first started it was the first place people told me to go and they were very correct. It enabled me meet dancers from across the whole city as it is a place where the whole community connects.When I was pregnant last year it was very difficult for me to continue dancing. BE enabled me to do so as it was outside with space and London venues were far too hot and crowded for a pregnant woman. It enabled me to stay healthy and happy and use dance to cure lots of pregnancy symptoms. I now have a son and it is has once again enabled me to keep dancing. Due to BE taking place earlier in the day than typical events it enabled me hours of dancing and to be back in time for night time feeds and also still be able the hours of sleep you need as a parent of a baby. There are very few places where you can do this.BE has enabled more diversity in the community as it enables people from all stages and walks of life to be able to get together. I am sure there are others in others who attend BE as it offers a unique environment and community which you cannot access elsewhere. I will also be moving out of London soon and unable to attend typical classes and events as easy. As BE is on a Sunday it will enable me to drive in without paying congestion charge and also continue dancing as a parent.Over the past few years BE has been one of the main things I look forward to coming in the summer months and I will be very very sad if it did not come back.,en,5.0,2024-06-23,,Jun 2024,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d26663269-r956325033-Bachata_Exchange-London_England.html,Bachata Exchange,"12 Primrose St, London EC2A 2EG England",5,161,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186338-d26663269-Reviews-Bachata_Exchange-London_England.html,"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.996174693107605}"

956325041,Zuzana K,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/zuzanak837,Great bachata community in London !,"I last visited Bachata Exchange in October and really loved it. Such a great space for dancers to get together. It’s probably my favourite dance community in London and I love that it’s outside and the location is great for my commute into London from Hertfordshire. BE is different because it focuses only on bachata and the clases are in Sundays, it can be hard to find clases to attend on weekends which are also accessible to all as BE doesn’t charge for classes but relies on fundraising. I was planning to go this weekend and saw that BE is cancelled and I’m so gutted.

In a time of cost-of-living difficulties for many, having free events like this simply makes economic sense. If people have more time and money available because an event is free and flexible, then people are more likely to support local businesses when visiting.It also provides a big platform for networking.

958078784,iona,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/throwmesomepaintbaby,A pillar of our community and the highlight of our weeks.,"Without a doubt, Sundays have become my favourite day of the week thanks to Bachata Exchange. I started travelling to London every other week from Brighton just for BE, then it became every week… and then it seemed simpler to move here! I finally live close by and my heart breaks at the thought of BE being permanently cancelled 💔 The magic isn’t just about the dance. Yes, bachata a fantastic dance and here you can dance in a beautiful space (with a great floor, under cover, and close to shops and the station) with people of all different levels for FREE for five hours *that go by in a flash* six if you include the free lesson beforehand too! But the community is the special sauce. I’ve met people from so many different backgrounds of so many different ages that I would never have met without bachata and specifically BE. Unlike other inside and very loud dance venues, at exchange house you can actually hear people you are chatting to, walk to the nice seating area at the back of the venue, and some of us have had picnics on the grass here in the summer before the social!The fact that it’s free and accessible means almost the whole bachata community in London turn up for a Sunday night dance (including all of the top level dancers) and because of this, we have dancers visit from all over the world. Every time I meet another dancer at a festival or abroad, and they want to visit the UK, I say they have to make sure to stay on Sunday just so they can come to BE - the best Bachata night of the week ♥️ I can’t express how grateful I am that Bachata Exchange has existed, facilitated, and fostered such a wonderful community. It’s a big part of me feeling at home here in London. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.",en,5.0,2024-07-05,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-w/2c/c1/16/00/caption.jpg,Jun 2024,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d26663269-r958078784-Bachata_Exchange-London_England.html,Bachata Exchange,"12 Primrose St, London EC2A 2EG England",5,161,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186338-d26663269-Reviews-Bachata_Exchange-London_England.html,"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9991341233253479}"

To be honest, it is way better than majority of socials/festivals globally.It's easier to access (next to liverpool street station).I know a lot of people discover bachata by accident. Sometimes, by ending up in wrong pub or seeing someone dancing in park and with time, they feel thankful that they discovered it and pursued it.BE makes it a lot of people to pursue this hobby affordable for a lot of people.Since London is a global city and if you experience that BE is the place to be, I have met people I didn't exist, with time I have become friends with many of them and I am thankful to BE for providing this community, a circle of friends with whom you can dance every Sunday and start the next week with a smile.",en,5.0,2024-07-08,,May 2024,0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d26663269-r958533869-Bachata_Exchange-London_England.html,Bachata Exchange,"12 Primrose St, London EC2A 2EG England",5,161,https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186338-d26663269-Reviews-Bachata_Exchange-London_England.html,"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9997077584266663}"
